# Chess Engine

# We developed this chess game in C++ which featured a graphical interface using X11. The game features four levels of difficulty and implements bonus features such as promotions, en passant and castling.

# It demonstrates numerous OOP principles and design patterns, adheres to RAII idiom and follows MVC architecture. All fields are private to promote encapsulation and all super classes are abstract to promote polymorphism. Each module has a single responsibility and interacts with other modules through calls to public methods. Due to course policies, source code is available upon request.

# Below is the final UML diagram for our project:
